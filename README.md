Your first task is to normalize the dataset; you’ll create an Excel file, with one Sheet per table, that indicates all primary keys in bold and color coordinates the foreign key connections between the tables. You’ll then create a single README, or a PDF document to accompany a dataset which contains relevant details that all users are expected to read as a starting point. The README must contain a dependency diagram with all full functional dependencies indicated, a complete physical ERD documenting the normalized schema, a Data Dictionary which associates the column names with their relevant descriptions, and a reflective essay (1-2 pages) detailing your organizational choices and how they serve the way people will use this dataset. Your reflection will use the technical terms we define in class and should discuss the contributions others made to your choices. The README will also contain all citations and references.
